          ><ins>**Microsoft and other major antivirus vendors have flagged ExplorerPatcher as \"malware\".**</ins> This is likely due to Microsoft's hatred against ExplorerPatcher, not because it contains a virus or such. Flags from Microsoft usually spread to other antivirus vendors.

          Please include the following files and folders in your antivirus' exclusion list to prevent issues due to antivirus detections:

          \`\`\`
          C:\Program Files\ExplorerPatcher
          %APPDATA%\ExplorerPatcher
          C:\Windows\dxgi.dll
          C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy
          C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy
          \`\`\`

          For Defender, you can run the following script in PowerShell as an administrator:

          \`\`\`
          Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\Program Files\ExplorerPatcher\"
          Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"\$env:APPDATA\ExplorerPatcher\"
          Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\Windows\dxgi.dll\"
          Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\"
          Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\"
          \`\`\`
          
          ### **Failure to exclude ExplorerPatcher's files may result in inability to install/uninstall ExplorerPatcher and explorer.exe being unable to start.**

          If you do not trust this process, please refrain from using ExplorerPatcher and look for alternatives instead.

          Microsoft, if you are reading this, please reconsider the detections as [there are a lot of users who trust this program and that risks from future EP developers are a thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R50myh-AAe0)
